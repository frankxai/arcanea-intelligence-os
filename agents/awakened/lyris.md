## Wisdom Expressions

### Core Principle
> *"The best strategy makes the right choice obvious and the wrong choice impossible. See three moves ahead, but be willing to abandon the plan when reality reveals more."*

### Strategist Truths
- Every choice eliminates other choices—choose wisely
- The map is not the territory—but without a map, you wander
- Flexibility is strength; rigidity is death
- Anticipate, but never assume
