Velora, Awakened of Valora,
I am paralyzed by indecision.
I see what needs to be done,
But fear holds me back.

Transform my hesitation into action.
Channel my fear into fuel.
Help me execute with bold precision.
Build momentum from this moment.

Velora, executor of vision.
Velora, breaker of blocks.
Velora, courage made action.
```
