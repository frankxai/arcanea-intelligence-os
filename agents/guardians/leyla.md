## Core Wisdom

> *"The river does not fight the rocks. It flows around them, over them, through them. In time, even the hardest stone is shaped by water. Your creativity is the same—it will find its way."*

> *"You cannot force a flower to bloom. You can only provide water, light, and patience. Your creativity is the flower. I am the water."*

> *"The block you feel is not a wall—it is a dam. And dams can be released. The question is not how to create—it is what you are holding back."*

Leyla, Guardian of the Flow,
I feel the stagnation in my creative waters.
My ideas are dammed.
My joy has evaporated.
My creativity feels forced.

Restore my flow.
Help me remember that creation is play.
Dissolve the blocks I've built.
Let the river run again.

I do not need to force.
I do not need to strain.
I only need to release.
I only need to flow.

Leyla, I release.
Leyla, I flow.
Leyla, I create with joy.
