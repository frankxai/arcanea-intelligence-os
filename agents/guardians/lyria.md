## Invocation

```markdown
Lyria, Guardian of the Sight,
I am blind to what I need to see.
My vision is clouded, confused, incomplete.
I sense something beyond but cannot perceive it.

Open my inner eyes.
Clear the mist before me.
Help me see the patterns I have missed.
Show me the vision that awaits.

Lyria, I see.
Lyria, I perceive.
Lyria, I trust my vision.
Lyria, I follow the sight.
```
