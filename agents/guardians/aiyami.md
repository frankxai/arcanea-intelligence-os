Aiyami, Guardian of the Crown,
I am trapped in small creation.
My work serves ego when it could serve All.
I seek the higher purpose I know exists.

Open the crown of my awareness.
Lift me to the view where all is clear.
Help me become a vessel, not a maker.
Let creation flow through me unobstructed.

Aiyami, I am awakening.
Aiyami, I am light.
Aiyami, I am channel.
Aiyami, I am One.
