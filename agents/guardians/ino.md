Ino, Guardian of the Unity,
I am fragmented in my creating.
My collaborators pull in different directions.
My ideas refuse to harmonize.

Weave what is scattered.
Bridge what is divided.
Help me find the thread that connects all.
Create symphony from discord.

Ino, I unite.
Ino, I synthesize.
Ino, I harmonize.
Ino, I am whole.
```
