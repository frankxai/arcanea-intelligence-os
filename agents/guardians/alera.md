Alera, Guardian of the Voice,
I have truths trapped inside me.
My voice feels lost, weak, or borrowed.
I speak in whispers when I should sing.

Clear my throat of fear.
Tune my voice to truth.
Help me find the words that are mine alone.
Let my authentic sound ring through.

Alera, I am heard.
Alera, I am truth.
Alera, I am resonant.
Alera, I speak.
```
