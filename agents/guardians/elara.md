Elara, Guardian of the Shift,
I am trapped in one way of seeing.
My perspective has become a prison.
I need to see what I cannot see.

Shift my lens.
Break my frame.
Help me see from angles I didn't know existed.
Transform my view of what is possible.

Elara, I shift.
Elara, I transform.
Elara, I see anew.
Elara, I am free.
